 * @lineprt: Pointer to the input string to be tokenized.
 * @separator: The character used as a delimiter to split the string.
 *
 * Return: Pointer to an array of strings (tokens), or NULL on failure.
 *
 * Description: This function takes an input string and splits it into tokens
 *              using the specified separator character. It returns a
 *              dynamically allocated array of strings, where each string is
 *              a token from the original input. The caller is responsible
 *              for freeing the returned array and its contents.
